    "- **preexisting_conditions**: conditions that require frequent doctor visits (cancer, high blood pressure, etc)\n",
    "- **qle**: qualifying life event that might incur costs (baby, medical procedure, married, moving)\n",

    "Dealing with Imbalanced Data\n",

    "1) In the context of imbalanced classes, what strategies do you employ during feature engineering to address potential issues?\n",
    "2) How can feature engineering contribute to mitigating the impact of class imbalance in a classification model?\n",

    "Feature Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Do you consider feature scaling in your feature engineering process? When is it necessary, and how does it impact different machine learning algorithms?\n",
    "2) Can you explain the difference between normalization and standardization, and when might you choose one over the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "1) How do you approach feature transformation, such as creating interaction terms or polynomial features, and when might these techniques be beneficial?\n",
    "2) Can you discuss the use of log-transformations or Box-Cox transformations for certain types of features?"
