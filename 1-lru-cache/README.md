# Overview

A Cache is a type of data structure that allows applications to store data temporarily (as key-value pairs).  Allowing for efficient retrieval of commonly accessed data

A Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache organizes data in order of use, allowing you to quickly identify which item hasn't been used for the longest amount of time.

# Goal

Fix the cache so all unit tests pass.  Note that unit tests are written correctly, the cache implemenation has a bug.
